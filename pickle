Pickle:

Can data python data structures and write them to a file in byte-stream format for retrieval later

import pickle

# open the file for writing/binary
f = open("mypicklefile.pkl", "wb")

# create a list called a
a = range(10)
a.append('whatever')

# write variable 'a' to the file
pickle.dump(a, f)

# create a list called b
b = a[5:]

# write variable 'b' to the file
pickle.dump(b, f)

# close the file
f.close()


# to read the objects back in from a file
f = open("mypicklefile.pkl", "rb")

c = pickle.load(f)
# c would be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,'whatever']

d = pickle.load(f)
# d would be [5,6,7,8,9,'whatever']

f.close()
