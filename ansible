Playbooks are a combination of Plays
Plays are combination of which remote devices will I be acting on and which actions to take.
Plays can have multiple actions/tasks

### Example playbook might look like this ###
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    hostname: pynet-rtr1
  tasks:
    - name: Generate configuration file
      template: scr=/home/myuser/ansible/templates/router.j2
                dest=/home/myuser/ansible/configs/router.txt
                
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: do something
      some_action
      
      
### Ansible Host File ###
/etc/ansible/hosts  # this is the default location

# In the file if you want to not enable an ssh connection to local host do the following
[local]
localhost ansible_connction=local

### To execute ansible actions ###
ansible local -m ping  # this tests the local group reachability
ansible localhost -m ping  # this tests a specific host
