import json

To see a list output in json format:
	json.dumps(my_list)
	
To write json to a file:
	with open("my_file.json), "w") as f:
		json.dump(my_list, f)
		
To load json in from a file:
	with open("my_file.json") as f:
		new_list = json.load(f)
	
JSON does NOT support a comma on the last list element
