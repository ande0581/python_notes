The top of a yaml formatted file should have three hyphens at the top. Python doesnâ€™t do this automatically

import yaml

To convert a list to yaml using standard version:
	yaml.dump(my_list)
	
To convert a list to yaml using the condensed version:
	yaml.dump(my_list, default_flow_style=True)
	
To convert a list to the more human readable format:
	yaml.dump(my_list, default_flow_style=False)
	
To write yaml to a file:
	with open("my_file.yml", "w") as f:
		f.write(yaml.dump(my_list, default_flow_style=False))
		
To read in a yaml file:
	with open("my_file.yml", "r") as f:
		 new_list = yaml.load(f)
