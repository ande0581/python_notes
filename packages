# In python 2
__init__.py  # makes that directory a package

# You can make the entire directory a package and call it like
import <dir_name>

# You can call a particular file by
import <dir_name>.<python_filename>

# You can add stuff to the __init__.py to import stuff at the package level
# This is useful to keep the names short that you reference in your program

# in __init__.py add below
from test_pack2.reuse_ex1 import func1, func2
from test_pack2.reuse_ex2 import yyy, zzz

# optionally you can also include which is used for * import
__all__ = ('func1', 'func2', 'yyy', 'zzz')

# then in your script you can either
from test_pack2 import yyy
print yyy

# or
import test_pack2
print test_pack2.yyy

# or
from test_pack2 import *
# this will bring in func1, func2, yyy, zzz

# to see the name space and what you can call based on package imports
dir()
